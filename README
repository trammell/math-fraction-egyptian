Math-Fraction-Egyptian

An Egyptian fraction is the sum of distinct unit fractions, for example

    1/4 + 1/28

Each fraction in the expression meets these requirements:

    * the numerator is equal to 1
    * the denominator is a positive integer
    * none of the denominators in the expression are equal

This module implements a number of algorithms for converting common
fractions into "Egyptian" fractions.
